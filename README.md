# Last-Name-To-End
Sometimes data comes in a last name fisrt form. It can also be messy with a lot of additional values 'ET AL' for example and hard to fix in excel. This program tries to handle some of those exception cases. It goes through a CSV file and writes to a new one with the rearranged name column. Python3.
